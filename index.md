**YouBee**
<br>
Actively building an app - YouBee - as co-founder and Chief Data Officer. YouBee is a transformative tool addressing the longitudinal decline in youth mental health, offering a non-invasive self assessment solution in the form of a simple mobile game. Through interactive, choice-driven scenarios resembling the game Episode, YouBee's multi-layer AI model takes users’ choice data and maps it to insights about what their key stressors are, and what types of remedies fits them best. This dynamic, personalised mental health profile is then used to make highly tailored recommendations for resources, tools and professionals.

**Can inflammatory negative sentiment predict in-degree centrality in online social networks? A Reddit data analysis**
<br>
This project investigated whether inflammatory negative sentiment predict in-degree centrality in online social networks. Using a sample of 5 submissions on r/UmbrellaAcademy, discourse around Elliot Page coming out as a transgender man was scored using sentiment analysis. The extracted data was used to construct a network of comments, and the in-degree centrality of each node was compared to inflammatory negative sentiment using multiple regression with time fixed effects. The results suggest that inflammatory negative sentiment does not have a strong positive effect on centrality, but instead a weak positive one.

**A data deep-dive into the 'cooking' Stack Exchange forum**
<br>
This was a data-driven exploration of the Stack Exchange forum on cooking. The project involved data acquisition with a Stack Exchange scraper, as well as the construction of an MVP Score, measuring the helpfulness of a user on the forum, using activity, text and time metrics. The score is a weighted index with PCA-derived weights. Using the index, various patterns were identified, such as the geographic distribution of helpful users (MVPs).

[**World Emissions Clock**](https://worldemissions.io)
<br><br>
At the World Data Lab, I play a key role in the development of, and insight mining from, the World Emissions Clock (WEC) tool. Launched at COP27, the WEC tracks and forecasts greenhouse gas emissions for 180 countries, 24 subsectors, along 3 emissions policy scenarios.

**Towards Low Carbon Prosperity**
<br><br>
Using the WEC, I led research on the possibility of a world which is prosperous yet sustainable - where developed economies can scale down emissions while maintaining wealth, and where developing economies can safely grow while keeping GHG emissions low. We found that if the rich countries adopted the best practices of their peers within each sector, level of emissions would decline to only 3.3 tons per capita—less than half of the world average and only around 20% of the per-capita emission of the U.S. We also found that the rich cannot alone solve the problem - it is crucial that both developed and developing nations take corrective action.

At the World Data Lab, I support the development of World Data Pro - a leading insights and analytics platform used by business strategy and consumer insights leaders, investors, policymakers, economists, and researchers to forecast and quantify addressable markets, discover emerging opportunities, develop market and product strategies, and quantify impact. My main involvement has been in insights-mining, QAQC, data acquisition and researching missing data.

[**Internet Poverty Index**](https://www.linkedin.com/products/worlddatalab-internet-poverty-index/)
<br><br>
At the World Data Lab, I supported the development of the Internet Poverty Index (IPI) with data acquisition, insights mining and QAQC tasks. Currently, internet access is increasingly viewed as a basic requirement, alongside access to food, clothing, housing, and energy. The ability to accurately measure internet poverty can raise awareness and identify the most vulnerable groups. This is what the IPI does.
